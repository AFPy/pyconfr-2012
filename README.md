# PyCon Fr 2012

This is a static dump of the old Django for PyConFr 2012. The original
code is in the `django` branch.

It can be deployed again by simply pushing on GH (which triggers a
Github Action), or by using:

    rsync -a ./ pyconfr2012@deb.afpy.org:/var/www/2012.pycon.fr/

See https://github.com/AFPy/infra for more information about the
server configuration on which this is deployed.
